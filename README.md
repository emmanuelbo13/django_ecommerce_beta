# django_ecommerce_beta
Django Beta project for a real ecommerce website.
All the code in this project is AI generated. The purpose of this project is to learn from AI how to do a fully functional and realistic ecommerce site to replicate and use to sell stuff online. Also, I'm planning on using this project as a base template to sell ecommerce sites to clients. 


Payment Integration 
- 1.  ðŸ›’ **Session-based shopping cart:** The cart is tied to the userâ€™s session
    
    **Stateless and Scalable:** it does not require saving the cart to the database unless extended to Logged-in users (later on). 
    
    **Persistent for logged-in users:** The cart can be saved to the database for logged-in users to review it later.

    1. Cart review: Display the items in the cart.
